## Description and Method

We wanted to create a blogging application where we could use passwords and sign out functionality so user could have a personal blogging account and write blogs with their peers. An application that allows user to write blogs along with other users, update their blogs, delete their blogs, and views all of the blogs as well as interact with other users in the near future. (Something like tumblr, but better).
